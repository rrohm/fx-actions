    <title>aeFXActions Framework</title>

  <body>
    <div>
      <p>A small but versatile framework for speeding up development of 
        JavaFX/FXML applications: use a declarative syntax for binding actions
        to the UI controls, for a clean separation of logic and presentation and 
        more fun with JavaFX.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Goals and Principles</h2>
      <p>The aeFXActions framework adheres to the following principles: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>perfect separation of presentation and logic.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Declarative binding</strong> of actions to UI Controls. No imperative glue code anymore. </li>
        <li><strong>Reusable action logic classes</strong> that encapsulate your interaction logic. In the 
          standard use case these classes are thought as singletons.</li>
        <li>One place to describe the common features o appearance, i.e., 
          caption, tooltip, etc.</li>
        <li>One place to enable or disable the action, regardless where and how 
          often it is placed in the GUI.</li>
        <!--<li></li>-->
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Bootstrapping</h2>
      <p>Compared to ordinary JavaFX applications with FXML UI, there are just a
        few steps to get started with FXML and the aeFXActions framework.</p>
      <p>The framework uses the controller factory callback of the FXMLLoader.
        So, you (merely) have to tell the FXMLLoader that loads your FXML files
        to use the FXActionManager as a controller factory. The followin example 
        illustrates the application initialization with aeFXActions:
      </p>
      
      <pre>
  public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
    FXActionManager myActionControllerFactory = new FXActionManager();

    // Shortcut, if you have a fxml without stylesheets
    //Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(
    //        getClass().getResource("FXMLDocument.fxml"),
    //        null,
    //        null, myActionControllerFactory);

    // use this approach if the fxml uses stylesheets:
    FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader();
    fxmlLoader.setLocation(getClass().getResource("FXMLDocument.fxml"));
    fxmlLoader.setControllerFactory(myActionControllerFactory);
    Parent root = (Parent) fxmlLoader.load();

    myActionControllerFactory.initActions();

    // optional: get the action by its type and parametrize it:
    MyAction action = myActionControllerFactory.getAction(MyAction.class);
    action.setText("Erste Aktion");

    Scene scene = new Scene(root);

    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.show();
  }
 
      </pre>
    </div>
  </body>
