fx-actions
==========

A small but versatile framework for speeding up development of JavaFX/FXML applications: use 
a declarative syntax for binding actions to the UI controls, for a clean separation of logic 
and presentation and more fun with JavaFX.


About the project
=================

Goal of the fx-actions project is to provide Java developers with a easy-to-use framework for 
implementing application logic in action classes and declaratively wiring them to an FXML UI, 
i.e., you create the UI with FXML, deklare the UI controls in the controller class and simply
annotate them with your action class. No more writing lots of lines for creating event handlers!

The project will open source, the code will be made available under one of the common OS license
(yet to be decided).
